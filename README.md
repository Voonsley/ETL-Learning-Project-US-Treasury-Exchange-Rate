# ETL-Learning-Project-US-Treasury-Exchange-Rate
This project is a hands-on ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) learning exercise using the U.S. Treasury Exchange Rate API. It demonstrates how to collect exchange rate data, process it for analysis, and load it into a structured database for further use.
This project was created to consolidate understanding of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and extend that knowledge by learning how to:
  1. Extract financial data from a web API (U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data).
  2. Transform the raw JSON into a clean, tabular format.
  3. Load the processed data into an SQL database for queries and analysis.

The tools used for this project were
  1. Python 3.x
  2. Requests – to connect with the API and retrieve JSON data.
  3. Pandas – for cleaning and transforming the dataset.
  4. SQLite – as the target SQL database for storage and querying.
